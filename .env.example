# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./strava_supercompensation.db

# Model Parameters (optional - defaults will be used if not set)
# These control how fitness and fatigue build up and decay over time
# Based on Banister's Training Impulse model used in sports science
# FITNESS_DECAY_RATE: How many days for fitness to decay to ~37% (1/e) of peak
# Higher values = fitness decays more slowly (you retain form longer)
# Typical range: 20-70 days. Endurance athletes often use 40-50 days
FITNESS_DECAY_RATE=42


# FATIGUE_DECAY_RATE: How many days for fatigue to decay to ~37% (1/e) of peak
# Lower values = you recover from fatigue faster
# Typical range: 3-14 days. Well-trained athletes recover faster (5-7 days)
FATIGUE_DECAY_RATE=7

# FITNESS_MAGNITUDE: How much each TSS point contributes to fitness
# This should be a small fraction for realistic CTL values. Default is 0.1.
# Higher values = fitness builds up faster from training
FITNESS_MAGNITUDE=0.1

# FATIGUE_MAGNITUDE: How much each TSS point contributes to fatigue
# Typically 1.5x-2.5x fitness magnitude. Default is 0.15.
# Higher values = you get more tired from training (need more recovery)
FATIGUE_MAGNITUDE=0.15

# Physiological Bounds - Prevent Corrupted Metrics
# These bounds prevent database corruption from extreme/invalid training loads
# while allowing realistic values for serious endurance athletes

# MAX_DAILY_LOAD: Maximum realistic training stress score per day
# 1000 TSS allows for ultra-endurance events, grand tour stages
# Lower for recreational athletes (~400), higher for pros (~1200)
MAX_DAILY_LOAD=1000

# MAX_FITNESS: Maximum sustainable fitness level (CTL)
# 200 CTL represents elite endurance athlete levels
# Recreational: ~100, Competitive: ~150, Elite: ~200+
MAX_FITNESS=200

# MAX_FATIGUE: Maximum sustainable fatigue level (ATL)
# 150 ATL represents high training/racing load tolerance
# Must handle race blocks and intensive training camps
MAX_FATIGUE=150

# MAX_FORM: Maximum form magnitude (TSB = CTL - ATL)
# ¬±100 TSB allows full range from deep fatigue to peak form
# Competitive athletes can handle wider swings than recreationals
MAX_FORM=100
