# Sport Preferences (0.0-1.0, higher = more preferred)
# These influence sport rotation algorithm and prevent overuse injuries
# Values should add up to approximately 1.0 for balanced training
# Example values shown are based on typical multi-sport athlete patterns

# EXAMPLE: For more balanced training with increased strength focus:
# PREFERENCE_RUNNING=0.30
# PREFERENCE_CYCLING=0.25      # Reduce cycling dominance
# PREFERENCE_WEIGHT_TRAINING=0.25  # Increase strength training
# PREFERENCE_HIKING=0.20       # Keep hiking for recovery/variety
# PREFERENCE_WORKOUT=0.0       # Disable if focusing on weight training
# PREFERENCE_ROWING=0.0        # Disable unused sports

# Sport Recovery Times (hours until sport can be repeated at high intensity)
# Adjust based on your personal recovery capacity and injury history
# Higher values = longer mandatory rest between intense sessions
RECOVERY_TIME_RUNNING=48          # High impact - needs more recovery
RECOVERY_TIME_CYCLING=24          # Low impact - faster recovery
RECOVERY_TIME_HIKING=24           # Moderate impact
RECOVERY_TIME_WEIGHT_TRAINING=48  # High intensity - muscle repair needed
RECOVERY_TIME_WORKOUT=24          # General functional training
RECOVERY_TIME_ROWING=24           # Full body, low impact
RECOVERY_TIME_SWIMMING=24         # Very low impact, fastest recovery
RECOVERY_TIME_SKIING=48           # High impact, technical demands
RECOVERY_TIME_YOGA=12             # Active recovery, minimal stress

# TIP: If you're injury-prone in a specific sport, increase its recovery time
# Example: RECOVERY_TIME_RUNNING=72 for runners with knee issues
