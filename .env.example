# Model Parameters (optional - defaults will be used if not set)
# These control how fitness and fatigue build up and decay over time
# Based on Banister's Training Impulse model used in sports science
# FITNESS_DECAY_RATE: How many days for fitness to decay to ~37% (1/e) of peak
# Higher values = fitness decays more slowly (you retain form longer)
# Typical range: 20-70 days. Endurance athletes often use 40-50 days
FITNESS_DECAY_RATE=70


# FATIGUE_DECAY_RATE: How many days for fatigue to decay to ~37% (1/e) of peak
# Lower values = you recover from fatigue faster
# Typical range: 3-14 days. Well-trained athletes recover faster (5-7 days)
FATIGUE_DECAY_RATE=4

# FITNESS_MAGNITUDE: How much each TSS point contributes to fitness
# Higher values = fitness builds up faster from training
# Default 1.0 works well. Increase if you adapt quickly, decrease if you adapt slowly
FITNESS_MAGNITUDE=1.4

# FATIGUE_MAGNITUDE: How much each TSS point contributes to fatigue
# Higher values = you get more tired from training (need more recovery)
# Typically 1.5-2.5x fitness magnitude. Higher for older/less trained athletes
FATIGUE_MAGNITUDE=1.7
