## Recovery Demands by Sport Category

### High Recovery Demand (1.5x base recovery time)
- **Running** (all types) - High impact stress
- **Rowing/Paddling** - High power output demands

### Moderate Recovery Demand (1.0x base recovery time)
- **Cycling** (most types) - Lower impact
- **Swimming** - Non-impact, full body
- **Skating/Winter Sports** - Variable impact
- **Most Sports** - Intermittent demands

### Low Recovery Demand (0.5x base recovery time)
- **Hiking/Walking** - Low intensity, long duration
- **Yoga/Pilates** - Very low intensity
- **Golf** - Minimal physical stress

## Cross-Training Recommendations

The system provides sport-specific cross-training suggestions:

### After Running
- Swimming (non-impact cardio)
- Easy cycling (active recovery)
- Aqua jogging (running-specific, no impact)

### After Cycling
- Running (impact training for bone density)
- Swimming (upper body strength)
- Hiking (active recovery)

### After Swimming
- Running (weight-bearing exercise)
- Cycling (leg strength maintenance)
- Yoga (flexibility, shoulder mobility)

## Environmental Adjustments

The system also considers:
- **Elevation gain** (affects running more than cycling)
- **Heart rate intensity** (sport-specific zones)
- **Speed/pace** (sport-specific thresholds)
- **Race flag** (workout_type = 1) for extended recovery protocols

## Usage

All activity types are automatically detected from Strava and processed with appropriate sport-specific calculations for:
- Training load (TSS equivalent)
- Recovery time requirements
- Cross-training recommendations
- Intensity zone analysis
