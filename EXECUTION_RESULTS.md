## 📊 Key Findings from YOUR Data

### **Top 4 Significant Correlations**

#### 1. **HRV RMSSD vs Form (TSB)** 🏆
- **Correlation:** r = -0.560 (moderate negative)
- **P-value:** 0.0001 (highly significant ***)
- **Sample size:** n = 45
- **Interpretation:** Lower HRV predicts worse form
- **Actionable:** When your HRV drops, expect form to decline

#### 2. **HRV RMSSD vs Fatigue (ATL)** 🥈
- **Correlation:** r = +0.444 (moderate positive)
- **P-value:** 0.0022 (significant **)
- **Sample size:** n = 45
- **Interpretation:** Higher fatigue correlates with higher HRV
- **Actionable:** Paradoxical finding - may indicate overtraining adaptation

#### 3. **HRV vs Fitness Adaptation Rate** 🥉
- **Correlation:** r = +0.408 (moderate positive)
- **P-value:** 0.0054 (significant **)
- **Sample size:** n = 45
- **Interpretation:** Higher HRV correlates with faster fitness gains
- **Actionable:** Good HRV = better training adaptation

#### 4. **Weekly Volume vs HRV Score**
- **Correlation:** r = -0.360 (weak negative)
- **P-value:** 0.0152 (significant *)
- **Sample size:** n = 45
- **Interpretation:** Higher volume slightly reduces HRV
- **Actionable:** Monitor HRV during high-volume phases

---

## 🎯 Leading Indicator Discovered

### **HRV RMSSD → Form (TSB)**
- **Optimal Lag:** 1 day
- **Correlation:** r = -0.483 (moderate)
- **Predictive Power:** Moderate
- **Actionable Insight:** "Monitor HRV closely - changes appear 1 day before form shifts"

**What This Means:**
Your HRV today predicts your form tomorrow. If HRV drops today, expect form to decline tomorrow. Use this for proactive rest day planning.

## 📈 Category Breakdown

| Category | Correlations Tested | Significant | Rate |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|------|
| **Wellness-Performance** | 7 | 2 | 28.6% |
| **Recovery-Adaptation** | 2 | 1 | 50.0% |
| **Training-Response** | 3 | 1 | 33.3% |
| **Health-Performance** | 5 | 0 | 0.0% |

**Insights:**
- Your recovery-adaptation correlations are strongest (50% significance rate)
- Health-performance metrics need more data or show no relationship yet
- Wellness-performance shows moderate relationships

## 💡 Personalized Recommendations

Based on YOUR actual data:

### 1. **HRV is Your Key Metric** 🎯
All significant correlations involve HRV. Monitor it daily for:
- Form prediction (1-day lag)
- Fatigue assessment
- Fitness adaptation tracking

### 2. **Set Personal Thresholds**
From your data patterns:
- When HRV drops → Form declines next day
- High fatigue → HRV increases (overtraining signal?)
- Volume increases → HRV decreases slightly

### 3. **Weekly Monitoring**
Re-run analysis weekly to track:
```bash
strava-super insights correlations --days 30 --export weekly_$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

### 4. **Volume Management**
Your data shows weekly volume negatively correlates with HRV. Consider:
- Monitoring HRV more closely during high-volume weeks
- Planning recovery weeks when volume spikes
