# 🤖 Enhanced ML Features - Implementation Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION READY
**Version:** 2.0 - Phase 2 Enhanced

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### Priority #1: Enhanced ML Features ✅

Building on your existing ML foundation (Performance Predictor), we've added:

1. **LSTM Time-Series Prediction** - Deep learning for CTL/ATL/TSB trajectory forecasting
2. **Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection** - Identify overtraining, illness, and data errors
3. **Bayesian Regression** - Uncertainty quantification with confidence intervals
4. **Model Comparison Framework** - Compare Banister model vs ML predictions
5. **Automated Model Retraining** - Weekly automatic model updates

---

## 🚀 New Capabilities

### 1. LSTM Trajectory Forecasting

**What it does:**
- Predicts your CTL (Fitness), ATL (Fatigue), and TSB (Form) for the next 7-30 days
- Uses deep learning (LSTM neural network) to learn your personal training patterns
- Provides confidence intervals for predictions

**Why it matters:**
- Plan training blocks with confidence in future fitness levels
- Anticipate form decline before it happens
- Optimize race timing based on predicted peak form

**How to use:**
```bash
# In daily workflow (automatic)
strava-super run --plan-days 14

# Detailed analysis
strava-super ml-analysis --forecast-days 14

# Force retrain model with latest data
strava-super ml-analysis --train-lstm
```

**Example Output:**
```
📈 LSTM Trajectory Forecast (14 days):
   • Current Fitness (CTL): 85.3
   • Predicted in 7 days: 88.1 (+2.8)
   • Predicted in 14 days: 90.5 (+5.2)
   • Model confidence: 85%
```

### 2. Anomaly Detection

**What it does:**
- Automatically detects unusual patterns in your training data
- Identifies 4 types of anomalies:
  - **Overtraining**: Severe fatigue + low HRV
  - **Illness onset**: Elevated RHR + declining HRV
  - **Data errors**: Impossible values or duplicate entries
  - **Unusual patterns**: Unexpected metric combinations

**Why it matters:**
- Early warning system for overtraining
- Catch illness before it becomes serious
- Identify data quality issues

**How to use:**
```bash
# In daily workflow (automatic)
strava-super run --plan-days 7

# Detailed analysis
strava-super ml-analysis --days 90

# Retrain detector
strava-super ml-analysis --train-anomaly
```

**Example Output:**
```
🔍 Anomaly Detection:
   ⚠️ 2 critical anomalies detected in last 14 days:
      • Overtraining on 2025-09-28
        → Severe overtraining risk detected
        → Take 2-3 complete rest days immediately
      • Illness on 2025-09-25
        → Possible illness onset detected
        → Skip high-intensity training for 24-48 hours
```

---

### 3. Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification

**What it does:**
- Provides probabilistic predictions with confidence intervals
- Uses Gaussian Process Regression for uncertainty estimation
- Quantifies how confident the model is in its predictions

**Why it matters:**
- Know when to trust predictions vs when to be cautious
- Make risk-aware training decisions
- Understand prediction reliability

**Usage:**
```bash
# Integrated into ml-analysis command
strava-super ml-analysis --days 90 --forecast-days 14
```

---

### 4. Model Comparison

**What it does:**
- Compares traditional Banister model predictions with ML predictions
- Shows agreement/disagreement between methods
- Provides recommendation on which model to trust

**Why it matters:**
- Validate ML predictions against proven physiological models
- Identify when models disagree (uncertainty signal)
- Get best-of-both-worlds insights

**Example:**
```python
Banister CTL (14 days): 88.0
ML Prediction: 90.5 (CI: 87.2 - 93.8)
Recommendation: Models differ moderately - ML predicts faster fitness gain
```

---

### 5. Automated Model Retraining

**What it does:**
- Automatically checks if models need retraining
- LSTM: Retrains every 14 days
- Anomaly Detector: Retrains every 7 days
- Tracks training history and performance metrics

**Why it matters:**
- Models stay current with your latest training patterns
- No manual maintenance required
- Adapts to seasonal changes and training phase shifts

**How it works:**

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Race Preparation

**Scenario:** You have a marathon in 16 weeks

```bash
# Week 1: Baseline
strava-super ml-analysis --forecast-days 14
# Shows: Current CTL 75, predicted 78 (+3) in 14 days

# Week 4: Build phase
strava-super ml-analysis --forecast-days 14
# Shows: Current CTL 82, predicted 88 (+6) - good progress

# Week 12: Peak phase
strava-super ml-analysis --forecast-days 14
# Shows: Current CTL 95, predicted 98 (+3) - approaching peak

# Week 14: Taper start
strava-super ml-analysis --forecast-days 14
# Shows: Predicted TSB +15 on race day - optimal form
```

### Use Case 2: Overtraining Prevention

**Scenario:** Increasing training load aggressively

```bash
# Daily monitoring
strava-super run --plan-days 7

# Day 15: Anomaly detected
🔍 Anomaly Detection:
   ⚠️ Overtraining warning
   → TSB: -28 (very high fatigue)
   → HRV: 15% below baseline
   → Recommendation: Take 2 rest days

# Action: Rest 2 days, then recheck
strava-super ml-analysis

# Result: HRV recovering, anomaly cleared
```

### Use Case 3: Training Plan Optimization

**Scenario:** Planning next training block

```bash
# Check current trajectory
strava-super ml-analysis --forecast-days 21

Current State:
  CTL: 80
  ATL: 75
  TSB: +5

Forecast (21 days with current plan):
  Day 7: CTL 83, TSB +2
  Day 14: CTL 87, TSB -1
  Day 21: CTL 90, TSB -3

# Decision: Current plan sustainable, adjust week 3 slightly
```

## 🔬 Behind the Scenes

### How LSTM Learns Your Patterns

1. **Input:** Last 30 days of CTL/ATL/TSB/Load/Ramp-rate
2. **Processing:** LSTM captures:
   - Your typical training rhythm (weekly patterns)
   - Recovery rate (how fast ATL decays)
   - Fitness accumulation rate (CTL building speed)
   - Load response patterns (your personal training response)
3. **Output:** Next day's CTL/ATL/TSB
4. **Iteration:** Repeat for 7-30 days forecast

### How Anomaly Detection Works

1. **Training Phase:**
   - Learns "normal" ranges for all metrics
   - Builds isolation trees for each feature
   - Establishes personal baselines

2. **Detection Phase:**
   - Calculates anomaly score for each day
   - Scores < -0.3 = potential anomaly
   - Classifies type based on metric patterns:
     - High ATL + low HRV = overtraining
     - High RHR + low HRV = illness
     - Extreme values = data error

3. **Recommendation Engine:**
   - Severity based on score magnitude
   - Context-aware advice (phase, recent load)
   - Actionable next steps

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### TensorFlow Not Installed

**Error:**
```
⚠️ Enhanced ML unavailable: Install TensorFlow with 'pip install tensorflow>=2.15.0'
```

**Solution:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install tensorflow>=2.15.0 keras>=3.0.0
```

### Insufficient Data

**Error:**
```
❌ Insufficient data: need at least 30 days, have 15
```

**Solution:**
- Import more historical data from Strava
- Wait until you have 30+ days of data
- Use fallback mode (no error, but lower confidence)

### LSTM Training Fails

**Error:**
```
⚠️ LSTM training failed - using fallback
```

**Causes:**
- Missing required features (CTL/ATL/TSB)
- Too many NaN values in data
- Insufficient samples (<60 days)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check data quality
strava-super ml-analysis --days 90

# Force retrain with clean data
strava-super ml-analysis --train-lstm --days 120
```

### Model Files Corrupted

**Error:**
```
Failed to load model from models/ml_enhanced/lstm_trajectory.pkl
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete corrupted models
rm -rf models/ml_enhanced/

# Retrain from scratch
strava-super ml-analysis --train-lstm --train-anomaly
```
