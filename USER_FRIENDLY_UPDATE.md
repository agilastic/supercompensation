## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Technical) ❌
```
🔬 Step 4.5: Wellness-Performance Insights

Analyzing wellness-performance relationships (last 30 days)...

🎯 Predictive Metrics Found:
  • hrv_rmssd → tsb (5d lag, r=+0.521)
    💡 Monitor HRV closely - changes appear 5 days before form shifts

🔥 Strongest Relationship:
  HRV RMSSD vs Fitness (CTL): r=+0.457, p=0.0027 (moderate positive)

Found 3 significant correlations from 17 tested
```

**Problems:**
- Technical jargon: "hrv_rmssd", "tsb", "CTL"
- Statistics: "r=+0.521", "p=0.0027"
- Abbreviations: "5d lag"
- Not immediately actionable

---

### After (User-Friendly) ✅
```
💡 What Your Body Is Telling You

🔮 Future Predictions:
  📊 Your Heart Rate Variability today predicts your Training Form in 5 days
     → Moderate confidence • Use this for planning ahead

⭐ Your #1 Performance Link:
  • When Heart Rate Variability goes UP, Fitness goes UP
  • Reliable relationship • Improving Heart Rate Variability improves your Fitness

📈 Based on your last 30 days of data
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Plain English: "Heart Rate Variability", "Training Form"
- ✅ No statistics cluttering the message
- ✅ Clear timing: "in 5 days" instead of "5d lag"
- ✅ Actionable insights: "Use this for planning ahead"
- ✅ Confidence levels: "Moderate confidence" instead of "r=+0.521"

## 🎯 Design Principles Applied

### 1. **No Statistics Unless Requested**
Users don't need to see r-values and p-values in daily workflow.
Statistics are available in full analysis: `strava-super insights correlations`

### 2. **Plain Language First**
Use terms people say out loud:
- ✅ "Heart Rate Variability" not "hrv_rmssd"
- ✅ "Training Form" not "tsb"
- ✅ "Fitness" not "ctl"

### 3. **Natural Timing**
Use how people talk about time:
- ✅ "tomorrow" not "1d lag"
- ✅ "in 3 days" not "3d lag"
- ✅ "in 5 days" not "5d lag"

### 4. **Confidence, Not Correlation**
Replace statistical measures with confidence:
- ✅ "High confidence" not "r=0.75, p<0.001"
- ✅ "Moderate confidence" not "r=0.52, p=0.003"
- ✅ "Some indication" not "r=0.35, p=0.02"

### 5. **Actionable Insights**
Every insight includes what to do:
- "Use this for planning ahead"
- "Keep your X high for better Y"
- "Improving X improves your Y"

## 🧪 A/B Comparison

### Scenario: HRV Predicts Form

**Version A (Technical):**
```
hrv_rmssd → tsb (1d lag, r=-0.483, p=0.0009)
Monitor HRV closely - changes appear 1 days before form shifts
```

**Version B (User-Friendly):**
```
Your Heart Rate Variability today predicts your Training Form tomorrow
→ Moderate confidence • Use this for planning ahead
```

**User Feedback Expected:**
- Version A: "What does r=-0.483 mean?"
- Version B: "Oh, I should check HRV to plan tomorrow!"

**Winner:** Version B ✅
